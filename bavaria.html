            <p>Until 1925, Bayern played in one of Germany's oldest football venues, the city's so-called first stand; 
                then for many years it shared the municipal stadium with the Munich 1860 club, after which the stadium 
                was popularly called “Sechziger” (“Sixtieth”). It was almost completely destroyed during the Second 
                World War, a lot of effort was spent on reconstruction, but still the stadium was opened on time and 
                accommodated 44 thousand people.</p>
            <p>In 2002, together with Munich 1860, a new stadium, the Allianz Arena, was built, where the team plays 
                all its matches. The arena is illuminated in different colors depending on the colors of the club that 
                plays there. The arena is lit red when Bayern are playing; blue - when Munich 1860 is playing; white - 
                when the German national team plays. Initially, the arena was co-owned by both clubs, but then Bayern 
                acquired the share of Munich 1860 and became the sole owner of the stadium.</p>

                <li>Incredibly, the first twenty-five years turned out to be a failure, the team was unlucky 
                    for a long time, and only in the 1924-1925 season did Bayern begin to have its first 
                    successes.
                <li>The most expensive player is Jamal Musiala (€ 110 million).
